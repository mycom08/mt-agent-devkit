# Sync Devkit Workflow

> **Note:** This file is for reference only in the devkit repo. The `sync devkit` command runs in **target projects** (injected by `init project`), not in the devkit itself.

Triggered by: `"sync devkit"` or `"sync devkit --auto"` in a target project's CLAUDE.md

The `--auto` flag skips the Stage 1 user confirmation. The update plan is still printed but no reply is required before writing begins.

Fetches the latest agent template files from the devkit GitHub repository and applies them to the target project, preserving all project-specific content.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, read from the target project's `CLAUDE.md`:
- `**Devkit source:**` — the raw GitHub base URL (e.g. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mycom08/mt-agent-devkit/main`)
- `**Devkit version:**` — the version currently installed in this project

If either field is missing or contains a placeholder URL, stop and notify the user that the devkit source is not configured.

---

## Stage 0 — Version Check

1. Read `**Devkit version:**` from `CLAUDE.md` → `CURRENT_VERSION`
2. Fetch `{DEVKIT_SOURCE_URL}/version.txt` using WebFetch → `LATEST_VERSION`
   - If the fetch fails (network error, 404) → stop and notify the user; do not modify any files
3. Compare versions:
   - If `CURRENT_VERSION == LATEST_VERSION` → notify the user: _"Agent files are already up to date (v{CURRENT_VERSION})."_ Stop.
   - If `CURRENT_VERSION != LATEST_VERSION` → notify the user: _"Update available: v{CURRENT_VERSION} → v{LATEST_VERSION}"_ and proceed to Stage 1

---

## Stage 1 — Resolve Changed Files

Fetch `{DEVKIT_SOURCE_URL}/changes.json` to determine which files need updating.

### changes.json format

Two formats are supported. Entries for older versions use a plain array; entries for v0.0.8 and later use an object:

```json
{
  "0.0.7": [".claude/agents/templates/..."],
  "0.0.8": {
    "files": [".claude/agents/templates/..."],
    "descriptions": {
      ".claude/agents/templates/workflows/Sync_Devkit_Workflow_template.md": "Added auto-approve, checksums, WebFetch fallback"
    },
    "checksums": {
      ".claude/agents/templates/workflows/Sync_Devkit_Workflow_template.md": "sha256:abc123"
    }
  }
}
```

When parsing, if the version value is an array → treat as `files` only (no descriptions or checksums). If it is an object → read `files`, `descriptions`, and `checksums` fields.

### Resolving the file set

Collect every version between `CURRENT_VERSION` (exclusive) and `LATEST_VERSION` (inclusive) in ascending order. For each version:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Version key exists AND file list is non-empty | Add listed files to the **targeted update set** |
| Version key exists AND file list is empty | No files changed in this version — skip |
| Version key is **missing** from `changes.json` | **Trigger full scan** — fetch and compare all template files |

Deduplicate the targeted update set after collecting across all versions.

**If full scan was triggered**, notify the user:
> _"No change manifest found for one or more versions — running full scan to ensure nothing is missed."_

### Checksum pre-filter (overwrite-strategy files only)

For each file in the targeted update set that uses the **overwrite** strategy (workflow files, script files), and where `changes.json` provides a checksum for that file:

1. Read the local installed file
2. Compute its SHA-256
3. If it matches the checksum in `changes.json` → mark the file as **skip (already up to date)** and exclude it from the write set

This avoids fetching and rewriting files whose content is already current.

### Update plan

After resolving, report the update plan to the user before writing anything:

```
Update plan: v{CURRENT_VERSION} → v{LATEST_VERSION}

Files to update (targeted):
  - CLAUDE.md (merge)
  - rules/Developer_Rules.md (overwrite) — Added strict-mode gate    ← description shown when available
  - workflows/Sprint_Workflow.md (skip — already up to date)          ← checksum match

  — or —

Full scan triggered (N files)
  Files to overwrite:  rules/ (N), workflows/ (N)
  Files to merge:      instructions/ (5), CLAUDE.md
  Files to skip:       Project_Priming.md, memory/ (5), working-record/ (5)
```

Then ask: **"Proceed with update? Reply yes to apply or no to cancel."**

- **yes** → proceed to Stage 2
- **no** → stop; no files written

**If `--auto` flag was passed**, skip the confirmation and proceed to Stage 2 immediately after printing the update plan.

---

## Stage 2 — Apply Updates

Apply only the files resolved in Stage 1. Each file is processed according to its merge strategy below. Log each file as it is written. If any file fails, log the error and continue — do not abort the entire update.

### Fetch strategy

Use WebFetch to retrieve all remote files. If a fetched file appears truncated or summarized — content is abnormally short, contains ellipsis, or is missing sections that are expected based on the file type — fall back to Bash curl:

```bash
curl -sf "{DEVKIT_SOURCE_URL}/path/to/file"
```

If both WebFetch and curl fail for a file, log the failure and skip that file; do not write partial content.

### Merge strategy by file type

#### Rules files — Adapt to mode

**Source:** `{DEVKIT_SOURCE_URL}/.claude/agents/templates/rules/{filename}_template.md`
**Target:** `.claude/agents/rules/{filename}.md`

Rules files were originally generated by `init project` with mode-specific content adapted to the project. Do not overwrite verbatim — apply the same adaptation that `init project` uses:

1. Read `**Mode:**` from this project's `CLAUDE.md`
2. Fetch the template
3. Adapt the content to the project's mode:
   - **`Mode: strict`** — remove or replace any GitHub-specific content (references to `gh` CLI commands, `status:` issue labels, GitHub mentions, PR workflows, GitHub Actions). Replace with the strict-mode equivalent (local MD file operations, `**Status:**` field updates, local review records). Use `Strict_Mode_Story_Guide.md` as the reference for strict-mode substitutions.
   - **`Mode: github`** — apply the template content as-is; it is already written for GitHub mode
4. Preserve any project-specific customizations already in the local file (tech stack references, tooling commands, project-specific conventions) — do not overwrite them
5. Write the adapted result

Applies to: `Agent_Common.md`, `Blocked_Request.md`, `Business_Analyst_Rules.md`, `CICD_Validation_Guide.md`, `Clean_Code_Rules.md`, `Developer_Rules.md`, `Product_Owner_Rules.md`, `QA_Rules.md`, `Retro_Rules.md`, `Story_Standard.md`, `Story_Standard_Dev.md`, `Story_Standard_PO.md`, `Story_Standard_QA.md`, `Story_Standard_TL.md`, `Technical_Lead_Rules.md`, and `Strict_Mode_Story_Guide.md` (only if `Mode: strict`).

#### Workflow files — Overwrite

**Source:** `{DEVKIT_SOURCE_URL}/.claude/agents/templates/workflows/{filename}_template.md`
**Target:** `.claude/agents/workflows/{filename}.md`

Fetch and write verbatim. No project-specific content lives here.

Applies to: `Create_Stories_Workflow.md`, `Plan_Sprint_Workflow.md`, `Refine_Sprint_Workflow.md`, `Resume_Story_Workflow.md`, `Shared_Pipeline_Stages.md`, `Sprint_Workflow.md`, `Start_Story_Workflow.md`, `Sync_Devkit_Workflow.md` (this file), `Workflow_Guide.md`.

#### Script files — Overwrite

**Source:** `{DEVKIT_SOURCE_URL}/.claude/agents/templates/scripts/check_devkit_version.ps1`
          `{DEVKIT_SOURCE_URL}/.claude/agents/templates/scripts/check_devkit_version.sh`
**Target:** `.claude/agents/scripts/check_devkit_version.ps1`
          `.claude/agents/scripts/check_devkit_version.sh`

Fetch and write verbatim. Create `.claude/agents/scripts/` if it does not exist.

#### Settings hook — Inject if missing

Check `.claude/settings.json` for the devkit update-check hook:
- If a `SessionStart` entry whose command references `check_devkit_version` already exists → skip
- If missing → inject it using the same OS-detection logic as `init project` Stage 4 step 6 (merge into existing `settings.json`, or create it if absent)

#### Instruction files — Merge

**Source:** `{DEVKIT_SOURCE_URL}/.claude/agents/templates/instructions/{role}_instructions_template.md`
**Target:** `.claude/agents/instructions/{role}_instructions.md`

1. Fetch the latest template
2. Read the existing local file
3. Identify **project-specific sections** — sections referencing the project's actual tech stack, frameworks, tooling, commands, file paths, or conventions (written or edited during `init project`)
4. Identify **role-logic sections** — generic rules, workflow steps, memory/record instructions that apply to any project
5. Apply updated role-logic sections verbatim; preserve project-specific sections unchanged
6. New sections added by the template → append verbatim if role-logic; append with `[UPDATE REQUIRED]` placeholder if project-specific, and notify the user

#### CLAUDE.md — Merge

**Source:** `{DEVKIT_SOURCE_URL}/.claude/agents/templates/CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md`

1. Fetch the latest template
2. Read the existing local `CLAUDE.md`
3. **Preserve** — never overwrite:
   - `**Mode:**`
   - `**Devkit source:**`
   - `**Devkit version:**` (updated in Stage 3)
   - `## Project Overview` content
4. **Replace verbatim** from the updated template:
   - `## Agent File Integrity`
   - `## Agent Session Management`
   - `## Agent Completion Reports`
   - `## Workflows` routing table (preserve `sync devkit` row)
   - `## Sprint Workflow`
   - `## Start Story Workflow`
   - `## Shared Pipeline Stages`
   - `## Refine Sprint Workflow`
   - `## Plan Next Sprint Workflow`
   - `## Analyst Workflow`
   - `## PR Approval Rule`
5. New top-level sections in the template not present locally → append after the last existing section

#### Project_Priming.md — Skip

Never fetch or modify. This file is 100% project-specific.

#### context/Document_Index.md — Skip (append new sections only)

Never overwrite. This file is project-specific (document paths, API spec location, agent working file references). If the template adds a new `##` section not present locally → append it empty at the end of the file. The `Last Updated` field is maintained by agents during normal workflow execution, not by sync.

#### Memory files — Skip (append new sections only)

Never overwrite. If the template adds a new `##` section not present locally → append it empty at the end of the file.

#### Working-record files — Skip (append new sections only)

Same rule as memory files.

#### Wiki files — Merge (append new sections only)

**Source:** `{DEVKIT_SOURCE_URL}/.claude/agents/templates/wiki/*_template.md`  
**Target:** `docs/wiki/` in the target project

Wiki files are project-owned — never overwrite existing content.

**If a wiki file already exists:**
1. Fetch the latest template version
2. Read the existing local wiki file
3. Identify any `##` section heading in the template that is **not present** in the local file
4. Append each missing section at the end of the local file with its heading and an `[UPDATE REQUIRED]` placeholder body, then notify the user
5. Sections already present → leave untouched

**If a wiki file does not exist locally:**
1. Ask the user once (covering all missing wiki files):
   > "Some wiki docs are missing (`docs/wiki/`). Do you have existing guidelines I can refer to — such as a Confluence page, a README section, or existing doc files?
   >
   > - Reply with **file path(s)** to any existing guideline documents
   > - Or reply `no` to write placeholder templates"
2. **If the user provides paths** → read those files and use them as reference to fill `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers in the templates before writing
3. **If the user replies `no`** → fetch and write the template with all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values replaced by `[UPDATE REQUIRED]` markers; notify the user to fill them in

**Expected wiki files:**
`Testing_Guidelines.md`, `Development_Standards.md`, `Code_Review_Checklist.md`, `{Language}_Style_Guide.md` (name varies by project)

> The language style guide file name is project-specific (e.g., `Go_Style_Guide.md`). Sync does not rename existing style guide files. If no style guide file exists, write `Language_Style_Guide.md` as the fallback.

### Cleanup — Remove Stale Files

After all updates are applied, scan each managed directory and flag any file not in the known expected set.

**Expected files — `rules/`:**
`Agent_Common.md`, `Blocked_Request.md`, `Business_Analyst_Rules.md`, `CICD_Validation_Guide.md`, `Clean_Code_Rules.md`, `Developer_Rules.md`, `Product_Owner_Rules.md`, `QA_Rules.md`, `Retro_Rules.md`, `Story_Standard.md`, `Story_Standard_Dev.md`, `Story_Standard_PO.md`, `Story_Standard_QA.md`, `Story_Standard_TL.md`, `Technical_Lead_Rules.md`, `Strict_Mode_Story_Guide.md` (strict mode only)

**Expected files — `workflows/`:**
`Create_Stories_Workflow.md`, `Plan_Sprint_Workflow.md`, `Refine_Sprint_Workflow.md`, `Resume_Story_Workflow.md`, `Shared_Pipeline_Stages.md`, `Sprint_Workflow.md`, `Start_Story_Workflow.md`, `Sync_Devkit_Workflow.md`, `Workflow_Guide.md`

**Expected files — `scripts/`:**
`check_devkit_version.ps1`, `check_devkit_version.sh`

Directories never scanned for cleanup: `memory/`, `working-record/`, `docs/`, `tmp/`, `context/` — these are project-owned and may contain custom files.

If any unexpected files are found, report them to the user:

```
Stale files found:
  workflows/Update_Agents_Workflow.md

These files are not part of the devkit structure. Remove them? Reply yes to delete or no to keep.
```

- **yes** → delete the listed files and log each deletion
- **no** → leave them in place; note them in the completion report

If no unexpected files are found, skip this step silently.

**Missing expected files:** After checking for unexpected files, also check the reverse — any file in the expected set that is absent from the local directory. Report them to the user:

```
Missing expected files:
  rules/Blocked_Request.md

These files are part of the devkit structure but were not found locally. Restore them? Reply yes to fetch and write or no to skip.
```

- **yes** → fetch each missing file from the devkit source and write it using the appropriate merge strategy
- **no** → leave them absent; note them in the completion report

If no expected files are missing, skip this step silently.

---

## Stage 3 — Finalize

1. Update `**Devkit version:**` in `CLAUDE.md` to `LATEST_VERSION`
2. Write `LATEST_VERSION` to `.claude/agents/devkit_version.txt`
3. Report completion to the user:

```
Sync complete: v{CURRENT_VERSION} → v{LATEST_VERSION}

Updated:
  - <list each file written>

Skipped (project-owned):
  - Project_Priming.md
  - memory/        (5 files)
  - working-record/ (5 files)

[If any [UPDATE REQUIRED] placeholders were inserted]:
  Action needed: N instruction sections need project-specific content.
  Search for [UPDATE REQUIRED] in .claude/agents/instructions/ to find them.
```

---

## Pipeline Rules

- **Never write before user confirms** in Stage 1 — unless `--auto` flag was passed
- **Never overwrite** `Project_Priming.md`, `context/Document_Index.md`, `memory/`, `working-record/`, or `docs/`
- **Fail safe on network error** — if any fetch fails, log it and skip that file; never write partial content
- **WebFetch fallback** — if WebFetch returns truncated or summarized content, retry with `curl -sf`; never write content that appears incomplete
- **Missing version in changes.json = full scan** — never silently skip an unknown version
- **Checksum skip is silent** — files skipped due to checksum match are listed in the update plan as "already up to date" but do not appear in the final written-files report
- **Log every file written** — the user must be able to see exactly what changed
- **Merge preserves project content** — when in doubt about whether a section is project-specific, keep the local version and notify the user
- **Report both unexpected and missing files** in cleanup — unexpected files may be stale; missing files may indicate a broken install
- **This file updates itself** — `Sync_Devkit_Workflow.md` is in the overwrite list; the new version takes effect after this run completes
