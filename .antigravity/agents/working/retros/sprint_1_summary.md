## ST-000002 — [ST-000002][DEVKIT] Build Software Workflow — Phase 1 Stages 1–3
**Date:** 2026-06-17
**Loop counts:** Impl→Reviewer: 0 | Impl→QA: 0

### Findings
- `[workflow]` Story AC said "Stage 2 spawns TL agent" but TL's binding refinement answer superseded this; AC was not updated before status:ready was set, requiring implementer to reconcile comment thread against AC body — **Fix applied:** AC synchronisation rule added to Product_Owner_Rules.md §5
- `[context]` No CHANGELOG.md existed; story said "update" without noting it needed to be created — **Fix applied:** CHANGELOG.md creation rule added to Developer_Rules.md §5

### What Worked Well
- TL's refinement answers were detailed and unambiguous; per-stage resume rules and agent spawn decisions fully specified
- Analyst_Workflow.md served as a clear structural reference for the new workflow file

## ST-000004 — [ST-000004][DEVKIT] Project-Level CLAUDE Template and Phase 2 Build Software Workflow
**Date:** 2026-06-17
**Loop counts:** Impl→Reviewer: 0 | Impl→QA: 0

### Findings
*(none)*

### What Worked Well
- Spawn prompt specified exact file names, placeholders, and state-file format — no guesswork required during template authoring
- Pre-PR gate exemption for docs-only stories is clearly stated in Developer_Rules §5

---

## ST-000003 — [ST-000003][DEVKIT] Build Software Workflow — Phase 1 Stages 4–5 (Scaffold + Handoff)
**Date:** 2026-06-17
**Loop counts:** Impl→Reviewer: 0 | Impl→QA: 0

### Findings
- `[instruction]` Spawn prompt did not flag the stale Stage 3 completion message placeholder; Developer had to decide unguided whether to update it — **Fix applied:** pre-spawn note added to Shared_Pipeline_Stages.md Stage 1 requiring orchestrator to review existing files for stale content before writing spawn prompts

### What Worked Well
- Having `Init_Project_Workflow.md` as a prerequisite read made the inline scaffold steps immediately clear — no guesswork on what "execute init-project-equivalent steps inline" meant
- Two-path structure (Path A Monolith / Path B Multi-Repo) in Stage 4 cleanly mirrors the pattern established in Stages 2–3

## ST-000005 — [ST-000005][DEVKIT] Wire build software Trigger + Update changes.json + Version Bump
**Date:** 2026-06-17
**Loop counts:** Impl→Reviewer: 0 | Impl→QA: 0

### Findings
- `[context]` `changes.json` has inconsistent formats across older entries; story prescribed the `new`/`modified` format but no rule documented it — **Fix applied:** `changes.json` format rule added to Developer_Rules.md §4

### What Worked Well
- Pre-work read sequence identified that ST-000002 had already wired the CLAUDE.md trigger — prevented duplicate work
- Working Record key decisions section confirmed the target version (0.1.1) without needing to re-derive it
